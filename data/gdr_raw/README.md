Raw Utah FORGE Extended Circulation Test data are hosted on the Geothermal Data Repository (GDR) and are not included in this GitHub repository.

Source dataset (GDR):
McLennan, J., England, K., & Swearingen, L. (2024). Utah FORGE: Wells 16A(78)-32 and 16B(78)-32 Extended Circulation Test Data—August and September 2024 Dataset. Geothermal Data Repository. https://doi.org/10.15121/2475065

How to populate this folder:
Download the required files from the GDR record above and place them in this directory (data/gdr_raw/), keeping their original filenames.

Note on this study:
This project does not require the full raw dataset to run. The subset of data used in the manuscript has been extracted and saved as data/derived/utah_forge_gdr1683_extracted.csv, which is the default input for the analysis scripts.
